# GSAP Cookbook

Example code snippets, templates, and guides for accomplishing common tasks with the GSAP animation library. 

Most code examples are written in Javscript or Typescript for React and NextJS at the moment, though the GSAP is framework agnostic and contributions in other frameworks are appreciated!

For other useful tools, guides and courses, check out the <a href= "https://gsap.com/"> official GSAP website </a>


## Contributing

The GSAP Cookbook is a community-driven resource. Whether you're submitting an idea, fixing a typo, adding a new guide, or improving an existing one, your contributions are greatly appreciated!

Snippets and templates in various frameworks are highly appreciated as well!

Before contributing, read through the existing recipes to see if someone else is already working on something similar. That way you can avoid duplicating efforts.

If there are examples or guides you'd like to see, feel free to suggest them on the issues page.

If you'd like to contribute new content, make sure to read through our contribution guidelines. We welcome high-quality submissions of new examples and guides, as long as they fit within the scope of the cookbook.
